# Wordle Clone (Work in Progress)

In this project I create a wordle clone in ReactJS. Wordle is a game where the user tries to guess a word with 5 letters. If the position of a letter is correct, the letter becomes green. If the guess contains a letter which is also in the target word (but not the correct position) the letter becomes yellow.

## ToDo

- Limit word to 5 letters
- Color letters of guess into corresponding colors
- Limit number of guesses to 6
- (For each letter include an input box?)
